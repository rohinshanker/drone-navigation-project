# Team 44 – Final Project Website Template

This folder contains a static website scaffold that you can deploy with GitHub Pages.

## Quick start (local preview)
From this folder, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Where to edit
- `index.html` – all content lives here
- `assets/css/styles.css` – styling
- `assets/js/main.js` – small JS (mobile nav + image lightbox)
- `assets/img/slides/` – exported slide images (optional; you can delete unused ones)
- `assets/docs/` – PDFs (slides, proposal, checkpoints)

## TODO markers
Search for `TODO` in `index.html` to find placeholders you should fill in.
